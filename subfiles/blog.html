	<h2><u>VR@Illinois to Grow as New Wave of Research is a Go <br> [AR Enhanced!]</u></h2>
	<h3>October 24, 2019</h3>
	<article>
		<p>Earlier this month on October 12, the VR@Illinois Steering committee approved the grant proposals of 17 research groups on campus while extending in-kind awards, such as access to the university’s VR facilities, to 24 more groups. In total, however, a whopping 63 teams across 37 different departments applied for the seed grant pool. While this marked VR@Illinois’ first expanded wave of VR funding across campus, the gap between demand for funding and the Illinois VR department’s supply was made apparent after only about 20% of research teams received the funds they wanted.</p>
	
		<p>At the October 22 kick-off meeting for the VR@Illinois Steering committee and their funded research groups, there was a sense of excitement over the growing demand in VR, yet also a sense of regret that the demands of all could not yet be filled. Jim Wentworth of the CITL’s (Center for Innovation in Teaching &amp; Learning) Innovation Studio and VR Lab, organizer of the kick-off event, expressed these emotions when he told the group that about $25,000 of seed grant pool money was granted, but much more was asked.</p>
	
		<p>VR@Illinois has already set itself apart as an important player in the history of virtual reality, backed by sums of money to fuel groundbreaking research and facilities. Within the last couple of years, VR@Illinois gathered $200,000 for new VR infrastructure around campus and found a whole other $500,000 for development on a VR archaeology course, the first of its kind in which students go on cave excavations within the comfort of Champaign-Urbana and the VR department’s high-end headsets. Following the major boost in funding for VR, this year’s VR research is the next step in the legacy of VR@Illinois.</p>
	
		<p>The new wave of funding may seem miniature compared to the funding of infrastructure and course development of the past few years, but the impact will not be. At the kick-off event, research groups gathered to connect with the others in the quickly-growing VR community on campus, and they each have short presentations on what their work would entail. From a diverse variety of departments across campus, research teams shared their ideas and listened; while one group expressed their desire to incorporate VR into children’s education, another two groups discussed their already-ongoing research into VR use in therapy. Other areas of VR research that were discussed were minority support in STEM, VR tourism, Media and Cinema Studies, and more. Groups even discussed potential use of other immersive technology such as AR, with one researcher wondering whether immersive tech could “give me some hair” on a livestream being sent out to supporters.</p>
	
		<p>While support for VR/AR research on campus has a ways to go to meet the high demand, there is an undoubtable buzz on campus for VR and its growing presence in our world. 2019 may have seen the kick-off to the first wave of VR research all across campus, but it certainly won’t be the last.</p>

	<h2><u>Stepping into New Shoes – Toward Gender &amp; Race Equality, One Step at a Time</u></h2>
	<h3>October 10, 2019</h3>
	<article>
		<p>At the core of sexism and racism, there is a misunderstanding of other groups of fellow human beings and the individuals within these groups. Sexism and racism are two of the most destructive issues that divide the human population today. With my “XR for social good” project, I am developing an application to help fix the issue at the center of sexist and racist ideologies: the lack of empathy and self-awareness that leads to misunderstanding. As per the UN (2018), one of the ways we can work on the issue of gender inequality is to “address unconscious biases and implicit associations that form an unintended and often an invisible barrier to equal opportunity.” In all areas of contemporary life, women and people of color still face inequality today, caused in large part by those of a more advantaged position. Those with power perpetuate the issues of sexism and racism in our institutions and broader social systems as a whole. My work will focus on these people – those with power – and will give anyone a better perspective on the actions and dialogue had by those in power. My application does not mean to imply that sexism and racism are only caused by those in the highest positions; these issues are prevalent everywhere and perpetuated by too many people, especially in the household where power dynamics aren’t the same across the world and across different cultures. Places such as the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and Oceania contain gross amounts of gender inequality, and America facilitates one of the worst race-related issues of our day: a system of mass incarceration which disproportionately hurts those of color. Here is a UN infographic depicting gender inequality across the world (the UN doesn’t speak as much on racism, largely since it may be more of an American issue than a global issue):</p>

		<p>Virtual reality is the empathy machine, more closely providing genuine, new perspectives than any other technology before it. I am choosing an interactive VR experience as my XR tool for social good because of its potential to immerse people into new experiences. In VR, a user can play the part of another character, which is the whole idea of my application; it is vital to the empathy-inducing experience.</p>
		
		<p>Where augmented and mixed reality can provide powerful tools for empathy as well, VR takes it to the next level of immersion and presence which will be necessary to persuade my users to gain a new perspective and make a personal change. In their study on presence and avatars in virtual reality, Fox, Bailensen, and Binney (2009) found the effect of VR presence on a user’s actions to be quantitatively provable in their lab. Upon finding their VR avatar would visibly gain more weight when eating candy as opposed to a healthy alternative, the women in their experiment ate less candy after their experience. However, gender differences were also proven to be a deciding factor in one’s response to the VR demo; the experiment found the opposite effect on males. Even after seeing their avatar gain weight with candy consumption in VR, they were influenced to eat more candy. My development crew will need to take this into account and demotivate negative behavior regardless of gender or race of the user in our experience.</p>
		
		<p>Much like Crawley (2018) claims we can create “engagement,” “empathy,” and “action” through the reality-altering power of AR, even more of these qualities can we induce in VR. Both extended reality technologies, AR and VR, are tools we can use for social good, however, one has the capability to fully immerse its user in a fully alterable environment, implying a more powerful social tool for a project seeking to give a memorable, new perspective and a new level of self-awareness to its user. Though VR comes with the downside of lesser levels of accessibility, we hope to make up for that in the quality of our experience.</p>
		
		<p>———</p>
		
		<p>My development team is working on a VR experience that looks to bring a new perspective on gender and race inequality to its users through complex methods never before seen. Beginning in a real environment, our experience has the user role play as a person of power in one of many situations. He/she then must interact with a hired live actor who is someone of the opposite gender and/or race in a position of power lower than the user. Through the extreme advancement of photogrammetry, the real encounter is captured in live-time 3D. The captured scene is then played back in virtual reality to the user, with one crucial twist: the user will experience a simulation of their real encounter this time placed in the shoes of the live actor with whom they had interacted. The user gets to watch how they interacted with this person of another gender/race, and they gain a new perspective on how their actions and dialogue may impact others. The user will achieve a level of self-awareness never before possible after getting to experience an interaction with themself. We aim to guide the experience so that users will gain positive takeaways from the experience, though sufficient testing on our experience must be done first to figure out methods to control the experience. Though, as a counterpoint, we must remain somewhat detached from the experience as we can’t have our biases find their way into the experience of the user, for the sake of a natural and ethical experience.</p>
		
		<p>———</p>
		
		<p>There is no one way to “fix” gender and racial inequalities, but our VR application seeks to help by shining a light on the sexism and racism found within those lacking empathy for those of different genders and races. Literally providing a new perspective on gender inequalities, race inequalities, and especially one’s role in both, the experience my team is developing will employ VR and photogrammetry technology like never before to aid in two of our globe’s leading issues.</p>
		
		<p>In the fourth chapter of his book Experience on Demand, Bailensen (2018) discusses how he has used virtual reality as a tool for social good. Before diving into his own experiments on influencing people for the better through VR, Bailensen explains the “overview effect.” Some astronauts have reported this mind-altering experience, where after seeing the earth from the outside for the first time, they come to view life on the planet differently. The phenomenon is not reported in all astronauts, though those who experience it achieve an enlightening that provides them with a new understanding of the “pale blue dot” we inhabit and, as well, what our place on our little planet is. There is a similar breakthrough possible in our experience. Taking someone out of their body and into another, very different body on the receiving end of their own interaction will surely be an educational experience, but it can also be an out-of-body spiritual experience. We will learn who we are and how to fix the world by putting a mirror up to ourselves in the metaphorical sense, but also in a sense that our technology can now physically provide. Let’s take a step back, outside of our own bodies, and observe ourselves. We may find unfortunate biases and other flaws, but only through our newfound self-awareness can we tackle the issues at hand. Following Bailensen’s desire, we want to continue bettering our world through the most powerful and immersive technology to date: virtual reality, and through VR, we are going to make steps toward ending gender and racial inequalities across the world.</p>
