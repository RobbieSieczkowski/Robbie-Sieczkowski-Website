Things to improve:

- Add borders to frame the page
- Markup/emphasize keywords for Google SEO (especially to help people find me as a scholar/vr developer/connection)
- Top nav bar comes down with you when you scroll
- Size up welcome text font by 2
- Size up CV and/or put it in an interactable window (iframe?)
